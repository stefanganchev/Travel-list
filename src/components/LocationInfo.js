      <h2>Lisbon:</h2>
      <h3>A City of Light, History, and Soul</h3>
      <p>
        Perched on the edge of the Atlantic, Lisbon is a city that hums with the
        rhythm of discovery and whispers the stories of centuries past. Known as
        the "City of Seven Hills," its cobbled streets wind upward to reveal
        breathtaking panoramas of terracotta rooftops, the glittering Tagus
        River, and the vast horizon beyondâ€”a reminder of Portugal's Age of
        Exploration.
